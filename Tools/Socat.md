# Socat
- Similar to Netcat but can forward ports and connect to serial devices.
- Socat can also be used to upgrade a shell to a fully interactive TTY.
- A standalone binary of Socat can be transferred to a system after obtaining remote code execution to get a more stable reverse shell connection.
