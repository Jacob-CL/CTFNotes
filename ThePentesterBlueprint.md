# The Pentester Blueprint
## Chapter 1: What is a pentester?

The PTES technical guidelines detail 7 sections:
- Pre-engagement Interactions
  - Planning phase, definition of scope, tools, cost, timings and other rules of engagement etc
- Intelligence Gathering
  - Intel gathered on targets to discover vulns, find OS, software versions. Other info could be OSINT stuff
- Threat Modelling
  - All previously discovered vulnerablities are identified, enumerated and prioritized. The purpose is to provide a systematic analysis of the probable attackers profile, most likely attack vectors and the assests most desired by an attacker.
- Vulnerability Analysis
  - The process of discovering flaws in systems and applications. From host / service ocnfigs to insecure application designs. Not all vulns are exploitable but should be included in the report as they may be exploited at a future date should an exploit be developed one day.
- Exploitation
  - This phase is the 'hacking of vulnerabilties' phase
- Post-Exploitation
  - The purpose of this phase is to determine the value of the compromised systemt to maintain control for later use. The value of the system is determined by the sesitivity of the data stored on it and it's usefulness in further exploitng other systems. 
- Reporting
  - Results and findings are documented. The report should have an executive summary were the results are communicated in a language understood by non-technical staff. Include evidence, recommendations and remediation steps.
 
Pentest Types:
Blackbox
- The target knowledge for this type of pentest is very limited, typically just a URL or IP address. It's the most realistic, authentic method that more accurately mimics a hacker.
- Lengthy, the less knowledge of the target, the longer the testing time required due to reconnaA
Whitebox
- Or 'crystal box' where the pentester is provided with a lot of information on the target. Documents, designs and even user credentials.
- Good for testing lateral movement in the environment from an existing authenitcation user.
- Can be a lot quicker as enumeration might not be
Graybox
- Somewhere between the two and are the most common because the lines between what you do and do not know is always going to be a little blurry
