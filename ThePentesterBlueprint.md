# The Pentester Blueprint
## Chapter 1: What is a pentester?
PenTesting Methodologies:
- https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/115/final
- https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/3-The_OWASP_Testing_Framework/1-Penetration_Testing_Methodologies

The PTES technical guidelines detail 7 sections:
- Pre-engagement Interactions
  - Planning phase, definition of scope, tools, cost, timings and other rules of engagement etc
- Intelligence Gathering
  - Intel gathered on targets to discover vulns, find OS, software versions. Other info could be OSINT stuff
- Threat Modelling
  - All previously discovered vulnerablities are identified, enumerated and prioritized. The purpose is to provide a systematic analysis of the probable attackers profile, most likely attack vectors and the assests most desired by an attacker.
- Vulnerability Analysis
  - The process of discovering flaws in systems and applications. From host / service ocnfigs to insecure application designs. Not all vulns are exploitable but should be included in the report as they may be exploited at a future date should an exploit be developed one day.
- Exploitation
  - This phase is the 'hacking of vulnerabilties' phase
- Post-Exploitation
  - The purpose of this phase is to determine the value of the compromised systemt to maintain control for later use. The value of the system is determined by the sesitivity of the data stored on it and it's usefulness in further exploitng other systems. 
- Reporting
  - Results and findings are documented. The report should have an executive summary were the results are communicated in a language understood by non-technical staff. Include evidence, recommendations and remediation steps.
 
Pentest Types:
Blackbox
- The target knowledge for this type of pentest is very limited, typically just a URL or IP address. It's the most realistic, authentic method that more accurately mimics a hacker.
- Lengthy, the less knowledge of the target, the longer the testing time required due to reconnaA
Whitebox
- Or 'crystal box' where the pentester is provided with a lot of information on the target. Documents, designs and even user credentials.
- Good for testing lateral movement in the environment from an existing authenitcation user.
- Can be a lot quicker as enumeration might not be
Graybox
- Somewhere between the two and are the most common because the lines between what you do and do not know is always going to be a little blurry

Specialist areas:
- Generalist
- Application
- Internet of things
- Industrial control systems
- Hardware
- Social Engineering
- Physical
- Transportation
- Red team

## Chapter 2: Prerequisite Skills
To assess the security of a target and to hack into it, you will need to understand the technology and the security. Deep knowledge of your target is required to be successful at penetrating the target.
- Security controls are the means and ways of protecting the information security of computer systems.
- Physical controls ensure that people don't have unauthorized physical access to computer systems and data.

Access control is often considered to be the bedrock of most information security measures. Keeping information secure is about making sure that only authorized parties have access to the specific components of information systems.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) permits access according to a user's role within an organization. It's the practice that you'll see most often in network settings. That's because it's a very efficient way to implement the principle of least privilege.
- Mandatory access control (MAC) is often used in environments with very strict security needs. It's associated with the multilevel security systems that were designed to protect data that has been classified by military and intelligence agencies.
- Discretionary access control (DAC) is the third major access control practice you'll often see as a pentester. The United States Department of Defense's Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) define DAC as â€œa means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong.

  ### Incident Response
  - Preparation: It may not be the CSIRT's responsibility to prevent cyberattacks, but they must be prepared to respond to them
  - Detection and Analysis: The detection systems from the previous step will identify an anomaly in network behavior, a data breach, malware, or some other indication of compromise
  - Containment, eradication, and recovery: In the containment process, network administrators may have to shut down or disconnect network segments or particular computers, disable certain functions or user accounts, or redirect a cyberattack to a sandbox or honeypot.
  - Post-incident activity: Post-mortem
 
### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
- As a pentester, your job is to discover vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities fall into two basic categories: zero-day vulnerabilities, which are unknown to cyberattack targets until a malicious actor exploits them, and vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and networking devices that you already know about.
- Known vulnerabilities are usually, but not always, recorded in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system.

## Chapter 3: Education of a Hacker
- It's important to keep notes on how to validate and exploit vulnerabilities. Note-taking applications like OneNote, Evernote, Keepnote, and Cherry Tree make note taking and organization easier and more effective.
- Installing software or hardware can be easy and straightforward, but when you run into problems and must work through those problems, you learn how to troubleshoot.
- When you find a vulnerability and try to exploit it, the exploit might not work. Not all exploits work all of the time, and you must work through the options or try other exploits. You learn to put together different exploits to help you reach the goal of the information you are trying to access
- Not all vulnerabilities are exploitable, but you need to ensure that they can't be exploited.
- The hacker mindset takes time and repetition to develop, and it is best developed by hands-on hacking experience.

`Technology Knowledge + Hacking Knowledge + Hacker Mindset = Pentester Blueprint formula`
