# Chapter 8 - A Quantum Leap into the Future
- Previous experience has told us that every so-called unbreakabke cipher has, sooner or later, succumbed to cryptanalysis.
- Tempest Attack - which aims to detect electrobagmetic singals emiited by the electronics in a computer's display unit. To defend against this you can buy a shiedling mateiral that can used to line the walls of a room to prevent the escape of electromagnetic signals. In America, it is necessary to obtain a government licence before buying such a shiedling fdevice, which suggests orgs such as the FBI or NSA are regularly relying on tempest surveillance. Essentially they're reading the plaintext before it's encrypted at all. It's another reminder that the Government will keep major crypto breakthroughs a secret. RE: James Ellis GCHQ
- The RSA cipher is used to protect the most important military, diplomatic, commercial and criminal communications – exactly the messages that intelligence gathering organisations want to decipher. If they are to challenge strong RSA encryption, cryptanalysts will need to make a major theoretical or technological breakthrough.
- Modern day 'classical computers' can not / will not be able to break RSA. Silicon chips will continue to get faster as the years pass, doubling in speed roughly every eighteen months, but this is not enough to make a real impact on the speed of factoring – cryptanalysts require a technology that is billions of times faster than current computers.
- "Anyone who can comtemplate quantum mechanics without getting dizzy hasn't understood it" - Neils Bohr
- Classical physics can explain the orbits of planets or the trajectory of a cannonball, but cannot fully describe the world of the truly tiny, such as the trajectory of a photon.

# Double-slit experiment
This experiment is the foundation of all the weirdness in quantum mechanics.
1.  You shoot individual photons of light at a barrier with two parallel slits, and there's a screen behind it to see where the light hits.
2.  That photon SHOULD go through either the left or right slit and on the wall behind, you'll see a bright light depending on which slit it passed through. What ends up happening is that you an interference pattern - multiple bright and dark stripes across the screen. This only happens when light behaves like a wave that goes through both slits simultaneously, and the waves interfere with each other. This happens whether you send a single photon or many (like a beam of light many)
3.  Now, if you set up detectors to see which slit each photon actually goes through, the interference pattern disappears. Now the photons behave like particles and only go through one slit each, giving you just two bright lines.

What this teaches us:
- Particles aren't just particles - they're also waves
- A single photon can be in multiple places simultaneously (superposition)
- The act of measuring/observing changes reality itself
- Things don't have definite properties until you measure them

This experiment shows that quantum objects exist in all possible states until measurement forces them to "choose." It's the experimental proof that reality at the quantum level is fundamentally different from our everyday experience - and it's the foundation for everything from quantum computers to our understanding of atoms.

There are 2 mainline theories in an effort to explain what might be going on here. Quantum theorists are divided into 2 camps:

## Superposition
The Basic Mystery: We know a photon starts at point A and ends at point B, but we have no clue how it gets there. Since we can't track its path, quantum physicists say it takes every possible path at once - this is superposition.

Schrödinger's Cat Explains It:
- Cat in box with 50% chance of dying
- Until you look = cat is both alive AND dead simultaneously
- When you look = cat "chooses" to be either alive OR dead

Why This Matters for Computers:
- Regular computers: Bits are like checking the cat - they're either 0 OR 1
- Quantum computers: Qubits are like the unopened box - they're 0 AND 1 AND everything in between, all at once

The Power:
- Regular computer: Opens millions of boxes one by one
- Quantum computer: Keeps millions of boxes closed (so cats stay in superposition), processes all possibilities simultaneously, then "opens" them at the end for the answer

The Key Rule:
- Superposition only works when you're NOT looking. The moment you observe/measure something, it's forced to pick just one state and the superposition disappears. i.e if you can't see what something is doing, quantum mechanics says it's doing everything possible all at once - until you peek.

## Many-worlds 
The second quantum theory is that instead of the cat being both alive AND dead in one universe, the universe literally splits in two the moment you put the cat in the box. There is a universe where the cat is dead and one where it is alive. It explains the Photon Experiment by saying that when a photon approaches the two slits, the universe splits.

Then these parallel universes somehow "interfere" with each other (called quantum interference effects), creating the striped pattern we see. So essentially, every time anything could go multiple ways, reality branches:
- Flip a coin → Universe where it's heads + Universe where it's tails
- Every quantum event → Countless new universes
- Result = An infinite "multiverse" of parallel realities

So instead of saying "the cat is both alive and dead" like superposition, many-worlds says "there's a universe where the cat is alive AND a separate universe where the cat is dead, and both are equally real."

Either argument is crazy but theyre the only quantum theories allows physicists to calculate the consequences of nuclear reactions in power stations; only quantum theory can explain the wonders of DNA; only quantum theory explains how the sun shines; only quantum theory can be used to design the laser that reads the CDs in your stereo. Thus, like it or not, we live in a quantum world.

NOTE: The same Thomas Young who helped decipher the Egyptian heiroglyphs (He figured out that some hieroglyphs represented sounds rather than just pictures or ideas) is the same Thomas Young who conducted the double-slit experiment around 1801-1803 that proved light behaves like a wave, laying crucial groundwork for quantum mechanics.
