# Chapter 8 - A Quantum Leap into the Future
- Previous experience has told us that every so-called unbreakabke cipher has, sooner or later, succumbed to cryptanalysis.
- Tempest Attack - which aims to detect electrobagmetic singals emiited by the electronics in a computer's display unit. To defend against this you can buy a shiedling mateiral that can used to line the walls of a room to prevent the escape of electromagnetic signals. In America, it is necessary to obtain a government licence before buying such a shiedling fdevice, which suggests orgs such as the FBI or NSA are regularly relying on tempest surveillance. Essentially they're reading the plaintext before it's encrypted at all. It's another reminder that the Government will keep major crypto breakthroughs a secret. RE: James Ellis GCHQ
- The RSA cipher is used to protect the most important military, diplomatic, commercial and criminal communications – exactly the messages that intelligence gathering organisations want to decipher. If they are to challenge strong RSA encryption, cryptanalysts will need to make a major theoretical or technological breakthrough.
- Modern day 'classical computers' can not / will not be able to break RSA. Silicon chips will continue to get faster as the years pass, doubling in speed roughly every eighteen months, but this is not enough to make a real impact on the speed of factoring – cryptanalysts require a technology that is billions of times faster than current computers.
- "Anyone who can comtemplate quantum mechanics without getting dizzy hasn't understood it" - Neils Bohr
- Classical physics can explain the orbits of planets or the trajectory of a cannonball, but cannot fully describe the world of the truly tiny, such as the trajectory of a photon.
- In an effort to explain what might be going on there is Quantum theory. Which is an explanation of how objects behave at the microscopic level and quantum theorists are divided into 2 camps:

## Superposition
TL;DR: When you put a cat in the box and look away, the cat is in all states all at once until it is seen again.

Begins with stating that we know only two things for certain about the photon - it leaves the filament and it strikes the screen. Everything else is a complete mysterym including whether the photon passed through the left or right slit. Because the exact path of the photon is unknown, superpositionists take the perculiar view that the photon somehow passes through both slits simultaneously which would then allow it intefere with itself and create the stripped pattern on the screen. But how can one photon pass through both slits? They argue that if we do not know what a particle is doing then it is alloweed to do everything possible all at once.

Schrodingers cat is often used to help explain the concept of superposition. A cat is in a box with a device that has a 50% chance of killing it based on a quantum event (vial of cyanide). According to quantum mechanics, until you open the box and look, the cat is simultaneously both alive AND dead - existing in what's called a "superposition" of both states.

- Regular computers use bits that are either 0 OR 1 - like the cat being either alive OR dead after you check.
- Quantum computers use "qubits" that can be in superposition - they're like Schrödinger's cat before you open the box. A qubit can be 0 AND 1 at the same time (or everything between) just like the cat can be alive AND dead simultaneously, it satisfies all possibilites, everything between 1 and 0, all at the same time.
  
So while a regular computer has to check each possibility one by one (like opening millions of boxes sequentially), a quantum computer can explore many possibilities simultaneously (like having millions of unopened boxes all containing cats that are both alive and dead). When the quantum computer finishes its calculation, it's like finally opening the box - the superposition collapses and you get your answer.

Superposition only occurs when we lose sight of the object, and it is a way of describing an object during a period of ambiguity. The act of looking at the cat forces it  to be in one particular state and at that very moment the superposition disappears.

## Many-worlds 
TL;DR: Cat in the box splits into many universes to represent each state and they somehow intefere with each other.

The second camp of quantum theorists claims that once you put the cat in the box and look away, the universe divides into 2, one where the cat is alive and one where it is dead. These two universes somehow interfere with each other, which accounts for the striped pattern in the photon experiment. Followers of the many-worlds interpretation believe that whenever an object has the potential to enter one of several possible states, the universe splits into many universes, so that each potential is fulfilled in a different universe. This proliferation of universes is referred to as the multiverse.

Either argument is crazy but theyre the only quantum theories allows physicists to calculate the consequences of nuclear reactions in power stations; only quantum theory can explain the wonders of DNA; only quantum theory explains how the sun shines; only quantum theory can be used to design the laser that reads the CDs in your stereo. Thus, like it or not, we live in a quantum world.
