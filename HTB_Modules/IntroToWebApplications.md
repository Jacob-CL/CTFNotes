## Web Application Components
1. Client
2. Server (WebServer, Web Application Logic, Database)
3. Services / Microservices (3rd Party + Web App Integrations). The use of microservices is considered service-oriented architecture (SOA), built as a collection of different automated functions focused on a single business goal. 
4. Functions (Serverless/Cloud)
