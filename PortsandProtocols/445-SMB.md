# Server Message Block (SMB)
- SMB (Server Message Block) is a prevalent protocol on Windows machines that provides many vectors for vertical and lateral movement. Sensitive data, including credentials, can be in network file shares, and some SMB versions may be vulnerable to RCE exploits such as EternalBlue. It is crucial to enumerate this sizeable potential attack surface carefully.
- Nmap has many scripts for enumerating SMB, such as smb-os-discovery.nse, which will interact with the SMB service to extract the reported operating system version.
- SMB allows users and administrators to share folders and make them accessible remotely by other users. Often these shares have files in them that contain sensitive information such as passwords. A tool that can enumerate and interact with SMB shares is smbclient. The -L flag specifies that we want to retrieve a list of available shares on the remote host, while -N suppresses the password prompt: `smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.42.253` This might reveal the non-default share users. Let us attempt to connect as the guest user: `smbclient \\\\10.129.42.253\\users`.
