The radio challenge ‘the eyes see through you’ was a sub-Ghz radio, direction finding, and decoding challenge. We broadcast a signal on 915 Mhz, the signal creates an image on the RF band waterfall, the image has multiple rows of the eye of suron open and closed, capture the image, decode from binary, then follow the RF signal to find the source, enter the decoded number, get the flag. We’ll put out a blog post soon about it.
