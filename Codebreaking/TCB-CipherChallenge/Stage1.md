- JPX  likely `the`
- MTN likely `and`
- B likely `i`
It kinda falls apart after these assumptions, despite ye old english and a weird last sentence:
```
A = c
B = i
C = o
D = v
E = y
F = b
G = l
H = k
I = f
J = t
K = q
L = m
M = a
N = d
O = z
P = h
Q = p
R = s
S = j
T = n
U = u
V = r
W = g
X = e
Y = w
Z = x
```
This decodes to biblical text from Daniel Chapter 5 (the writing on the wall):
```
in the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and
wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the
wall of the king's palace; and the king saw the part of the
hand that wrote. then the king's countenance was changed,
and his thoughts troubled him, so that the Soints of his
loins were loosed, and his knes smote one against
another. the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers,
the chaldeans, and the soothsayers. and the king spake,
and said to the wise men of babylon, whosoever shall read
this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof,
shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold
about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the
kingdom. then came in all the king's wise men; but they
could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the
interpretation thereof. then was king belshazzar greatly
troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his
lords were astonished. now the Kuen, by reason of the
words of the king and his lords, came into the banKuet
house; and the Kuen spake and said, o king, live forever;
let not thy thoughts trouble the, nor let thy countenance
be changed; there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the
spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father
light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the
gods, was found in him; whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy
father, the king, i say, thy father, made master of the
astrologers, magicians, forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge,
understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard
sentences, and disolving of doubts, were found in the
same daniel, whom the king named belteshazzar; now let
daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation. the
first codeword is othello.
